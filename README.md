# Project-22
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 22 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It has some a fairy sprite that can move and also a star sprite that can fall on clicking down arrow. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
